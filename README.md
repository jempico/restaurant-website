As part of WesBos CSS Grid Course, I created a responsive restaurant website using CSS Grid.

Things I've learned while doing it:

1. How to layout a fully resposive webpage using CSS Grid, with little media queries involved.
2. How to hide and show a navigation button with JavaScript.
3. How to change the attribute of a DOM element with JavaScript.
